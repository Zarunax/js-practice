// use the following structure to write your own functions. you can copy and change bits
function functionName (parameter) {
    console.log('Do something with ' + parameter)
}

// 1. Write a function that takes a good and logs "I love [the food]"
// 2. Write a function that taks a city and logs "I want to visit [city]"
// 3. Write a function that taks a name and *returns* "Hi, [name]!" instead of logging it.
//
// HINT: When I write 'takes' I'd say the template function above 'takes' a parameter named parameter. 
// HINT: []'s just means whatever the parameter is - eg in the template function "Do something with [parameter]'
// I don't mean that the final output needs to include []'s, its just my way of showing you where the parameter should be'
